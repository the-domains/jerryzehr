**_Will Tomorrow Be Too Late When I Want to Get
More Out of Life?_**

Have you ever wondered what you
would change in your life if you found out you had only 10 years to live?

Do you know the song "One Day to
Late "by Skillet?

Here are some of the powerful lyrics
to the song

\[box\] Tick tock, hear the clock
count down, Wish the minute hand could be rewound;

So much to do, and so much I need
to say, Will tomorrow be too late?

Time passes by, Never thought I'd
wind up, One step behind; Now I've made my mind up... Today, I'm gonna try a
little harder;

Gonna make every minute last
longer; Gonna learn to forgive and forget, 'Cause we don't have long, gonna
make the most of it; Today, I'm gonna love my enemies;

Reach out to somebody who needs
me; Make a change, make the world a better place, 'Cause tomorrow could be one
day too late...

One day too late... One day too
late...\[/box\]

****

**Do you find
yourself putting things off that you really want to do today?**

The words from this song are
thought provoking.

__

_Gonna learn to forgive and
forget,_

__

Cause we don't have long, gonna make the most of it;

__

Cause tomorrow could be one day too late...

## 

Time Comes Whether We're Ready or
Not

We all find excuses for putting
off things that are important to us.We get bogged down with every day tasks.

They always say the "squeaky
wheel gets the oil."

We can easily lose focus on what
is really important and find ourselves giving our energy to things that squeak
the loudest.

Sometimes just because a task or
problem seem to squeak the loudest doesn't mean it is the most important thing
to us.

How Do You Make Sure You Get the
Most Out of Life?

\[box\] 

Some
people drift through their entire life.

_They do it one day at a time, one
week at a time, one month at a time. _

__

_It happens so gradually they are
unaware of how their lives are slipping away until it's too late._

The First
Thing I Do **

****

**Be clear
about what is really important.**

What are my priorities?

Then I asked myself, what am I
really spending my time and energy on?

I really wanted to write more and
exercise more but when I evaluated how I was spending my time,I realized I was
sitting in front of the TV way more than I wanted to.

Once I sat down in front of the
TV I would zone out and lose all motivation to do anything creative or physical.

****

**I had to get
honest and ask myself a couple of questions:**

Do I really want to bike and run
or is it just a nice idea?

Do I really want to write or is
it just a nice idea?

If I really don't want to do the
things I say I want to, then get honest with myself and become ok with sitting
in front of the TV all night.

Once I realized I wanted to get
more out of my life, I needed to do everything I could to realize my goals?

__

_The most important step was
getting clear about what I really wanted to get out of life?_

I wrote an article 

3 Steps to Developing a Plan for Self
Discovery

that takes
the theme of Getting the Most Out of Life to the next level of implementation.

In fact if you read my blogs you
see my focus is on trying to bring the fullness of life to myself and others.

Why?

##### 

A True Story 

When I was a senior in high
school the glands under my jawbone started swelling up to the size of a
baseball.

Beside the fact I felt very tired
I had no pain. It was almost funny the way I looked; except when I went into
the hospital I found out I might have a form of cancer that would give me only
6 weeks to live.

Everyone was very hush, hush and
would not tell me anything. The minister came and stood over my bed and with a
serious voice asked me if I was ready?

"Ready for what?" I
wondered.

[][0]

Now I started to get a little
worried,"what was going on here?"I thought to myself.

I didn't know what to say and
just looked at him. He asked if he could have a prayer and I nodded my head and
said "sure."

That night after everyone had
left the room and the nurse came in, I asked her what was going on? I told her
I was frustrated because no one had told me anything about why I was in the
hospital.

She looked at me for a moment and
then explained.

_"They thought you had a serious form of cancer that could not
be cured but most of the reports have come back negative and it looks like you
have an extreme case of mononucleosis."_

(I should mention this was back
in 1973 before we had such good testing for cancer and other diseases.)

I was stuck on the words "most of
the tests" and asked her what she meant by 

most

?

She explained, they were waiting
for one last test to come back and they would know for sure by tomorrow.

That evening I laid in bed
imagining what I would do if I had a short time to live. It was very scary but
ended up being a life changing experience.

I really looked hard at my life
and what my focus had been on. If I lived, what did I want the focus of my life
to be.

****

**Have you had
an experience that gave you the opportunity to ask what you wanted your life to
be about?**

If you haven't an experience like
I described, I invite you to imagine yourself in the hospital with the doctor
saying,"

you have 10 years to live."

How would you spend your time?

You would still need to work to
support yourself for the next 10 years but what type of work would you be
doing?

How would you spend your free
time?

Yes, we all make a bucket list,
but I want you think more day-to-day.

What will you give your energy
to? What will you do that is fulfilling and enriching?

What are the first words of the
song?

_Tick tock, hear the clock count
down,_

______

Wish the minute hand could be rewound;

__

So much to do, and so much I need to say,

__

Will tomorrow be too late?

I would love to hear some of your
thought around this theme of getting more out of your life.

Have you had an experience that
changed your perspective on life?

What is it that you have decided
to do today rather than wait till tomorrow?

Be a Miracle

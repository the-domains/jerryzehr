I have traveled the world studying the major religions of the world. I have found the desire for true peace and happiness comes through the discovery of our inner soul. I believe part of my life purpose is to help people realize their true essence and share their presence with everyone around them. My novel Blurring the Lines is based on a true story. It is a intriguing and suspense filled story of a young man's journey on his quest for to find his life's purpose. Jerry is a Equity actor performing in more than 50 musicals and dramas. He is a minister in the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), serving local congregations for more than 30 years. He is an avid poker player who plays in the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas each year. Jerry has worked locally and internationally with interfaith causes to build bridges of peace and understanding.
